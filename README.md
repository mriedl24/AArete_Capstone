# AArete_Capstone Project - The State of Iowa Cancer Trends

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a capstone experience in partnership with AArete, focused on understanding cancer trends in Iowa. Our research explores the contributing factors behind the state’s rising cancer incidence rates specifically in Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Lung Cancer and Melanoma of the Skin. Using publicly available health data, we examined risk factors as well as risky behaviors. Our goal was to uncover insights that explain Iowa’s deviation from national patterns and to develop predictive models that can inform more targeted public health strategies.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Presentation

Folder Contains Final Deliverables

    - PowerPoint used in final presentation
    - Poster Summarizing our project

### 2. Process

This folder contains all scripts, data, and documentation used to clean, analyze, and model the data for this project. It is organized into three subfolders:

data_cleaning/
Contains the Python code used to merge and preprocess datasets from the U.S. Cancer Registry into a unified dataset. This step includes data cleaning, formatting, and preparation for analysis.

modeling/
Includes Jupyter Notebook scripts for developing linear regression models as well as Tableau visualizations used in the final presentation. This section showcases both statistical and visual approaches to analyzing cancer trends.

final_dataset/
Stores the finalized dataset used for modeling and presentation. This version reflects all preprocessing and is the basis for all analysis conducted in the project.

### 3. Report

This section provides an executive summary of our analysis, highlighting:

    🔍 Core research questions addressed
    🧪 Data sources and analytical methods applied
    💡 Key findings and trends identified
    📈 Actionable recommendations for public health strategy

### Executive Summary

The executive summary, found in the report/ folder, provides a concise overview of the project’s purpose, key research questions, methodology, and the strategic implications of our findings. It serves as a high-level reference to quickly understand the goals and outcomes of the analysis.
